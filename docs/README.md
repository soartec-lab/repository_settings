# ADR

`ADR`` is a document that records important architectural decisions.

Records will be kept if there are changes in technology selection or system configuration.

# Design Doc

`Design Doc` records development decisions.

If there is a change in architecture or introduction of new technology during design, we will write a separate `ADR`.
